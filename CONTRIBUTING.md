Contribution Guidelines
-------------------------

Contributions are welcome!  Bug fixes are a priority, as are open issues in the Github issue tracker.  Improvements will be considered.  

All submissions and reviewers should try to keep to the following principles:

* Everyone involved in PyWE should strive to be nice, and if anyone is not nice for any reason, politely tell them and they ought to correct their behavior
* Everyone should strive to communicate very clearly.  Explaining not only what your changes are, but what your intent is makes everything so much easier for everyone
* Everyone is welcome to contribute, but not every contribution is going to make it.  That said, we do have a pluggable architecture, so go ahead and make your own plugin!  Link to PyWE when you do and tell us about it - we'll link back and we love to hear what people are doing!  
* PyWE maintainers will strive to be reachable and communicative through multiple channels, but this is an entirely volunteer projected hosted at Github, so it's strictly best effort
